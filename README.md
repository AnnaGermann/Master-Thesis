## Engineering of Triterpenoid Synthesis and Metabolic Modeling in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803

Supporting code for:

- the identification of possible modifications targets, improving product formation, via metabolic modeling. Fluxes showing the highest increase,       when product synthesis is enforced, were selected. 
- the analysis of chlorophyll, phycocyanin and protein content. 
- the calculation of phycocyanin/chlorophyll ratio and carotenoid absorbance.
- platereader analysis of Nile Red fluorometric measurements.
- spectra analysis.
- the modeling and fitting of bacterial growth with the Gompertz equation.
- the statistical analysis of the respective experiments.
